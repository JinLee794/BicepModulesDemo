In order to successfully deploy and test all ARM/Bicep modules in your desired environment some modules require certain Azure resources to be deployed beforehand.

> **Note:** If we speak of **modules** in this context we mean the **services** which get created from these modules.

# Resources deployed by the dependency workflow

Together with the resource modules pipelines, we are providing a dependency pipeline, leveraging resource parameters from the `utilities\dependencies` subfolder and either one of the following pipelines:
- GitHub workflow: `.github\workflows\platform.dependencies.yml`
- Azure DevOps pipeline: `.azuredevops\platformPipelines\platform.dependencies.yml`

The resources deployed by the dependency workflow need to be in place before testing all the modules. Some of them (e.g. [storage account], [key vault] and [event hub namespace]) require a globally unique resource name. Before running the dependency workflow, it is required to update those values and their corresponding references in the resource modules parameters.

> Note: By default, the parameter files make use of the placeholder token `'<<namePrefix>>'` to make all resource names specific to an environment. Refer to [Parameter File Tokens Design](./The%20CI%20environment%20-%20Token%20replacement) for more details.

Some of the resources integrated with the full dependency pipeline are disabled by default as they require more time to be deployed or because they may cause issues when running in parallel with some of our module validation pipelines. Those are the sqlmi dependencies and the resources needed to build and distribute a VHD in a storage account. We suggest to enable them explicitly in case you need to onboard the modules requiring them, i.e. respectively [SQL managed instance], [compute disks] and [compute images].

Since also dependency resources are in turn subject to dependencies with each other, resources are deployed in the following grouped order.

<details>
<summary><b>1st</b> level resources</summary>

  1. Resource Groups: Leveraged by all modules. Multiple instances are deployed:
     - 'validation-rg': The resource group to which resources are deployed by default during the test deployment phase. This same resource group is also the one hosting the dependencies.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>2nd</b> level resources</summary>

This group of resources has a dependency only on the resource group which will host them. Resources in this group can be deployed in parallel.

  1. Storage account: This resource is leveraged by all resources supporting diagnostic settings on a storage account.
      >**Note**: This resource has a global scope name.
  1. Event hub namespace and Event hub: This resource is leveraged by all resources supporting diagnostic settings on an event hub.
      >**Note**: This resource has a global scope name.
  1. Log analytics workspaces: These resources are leveraged by all resources supporting diagnostic settings on LAW. Multiple instances are deployed:
      - '_adp-\<<namePrefix\>>-az-law-x-001_': Default LAW.
      - '_adp-\<<namePrefix\>>-az-law-aut-001_': Dedicated LAW to be leveraged by the [automation account] resource.
      - '_adp-\<<namePrefix\>>-az-law-appi-001_': Dedicated LAW to be leveraged by the [application insights] resource.
  1. User assigned identity: This resource is leveraged by the [role assignment], [key vault] and [recovery services vault] dependency resources.
      > **Note**: The object ID of the [user assigned identity] is needed by several dependency parameter files. However, before running the dependency pipeline for the first time, the [user assigned identity] resource does not exist yet, thus its object ID is unknown. For this reason, instead of the object ID value, some dependency parameter files contain the `"<<msiPrincipalId>>"` token, for which the correct value is retrieved and replaced by the pipeline at runtime.
  1. Shared image gallery and definition: These resources are leveraged by the [image template] resource.
  1. Route table: This resource is leveraged by the virtual network subnet dedicated to test [SQL managed instance].
      >**Note**: This resource is deployed and configured only if sqlmi dependency resources are enabled.
  1. Route table: This resource is leveraged by a test subnet deployment of the [Virtual Network] module.
  1. Action group: This resource is leveraged by [activity log alert] and [metric alert] resources.
  1. Application security group: This resource is leveraged by the [network security group] resource.
  1. Policy assignment: This resource is leveraged by the [policy exemption] resource.
  1. Proximity placement group: This resource is leveraged by a test deployment of the [Availability set] module.
