# Bicep to ARM conversion script

At the time of writing bicep is still in a beta phase. For this reason, some people may want to wait for bicep's _General Availability_ and prefer to use ARM Templates for the time being.
For these scenarios, the CARML library provides a script that uses the Bicep Toolkit translator/compiler to support the conversion of CARML Bicep modules to ARM templates.
This page documents the conversion utility and how to use it.

# Location

You can find the script under `/utilities/tools/ConvertTo-ARMTemplate.ps1`

# How it works

The script finds all 'deploy.bicep' files and tries to convert them to json-based ARM templates
by using the following steps.
1. Remove existing deploy.json files
1. Convert bicep files to json
1. Remove bicep metadata from json
1. Remove bicep files and folders
1. Update pipeline files - Replace .bicep with .json in pipeline files

# How to use it

For details on how to use the function please refer to the script's local documentation.
> **Note:** The script must be loaded before the function can be invoked
