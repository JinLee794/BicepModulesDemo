In case you want to simply consume the modules of the library to build a solution, you only have to perform a few simple steps:

1. [Download the library](#1-download-the-library)
1. [(Optional) Convert library to ARM](#2-optional-convert-library-to-arm)
1. [Build a solution](#3-build-a-solution)

# 1. Download the library

To gather a local copy of the library, you essentially have a few options to choose from:

<details>
<summary>Download a release</summary>

To download a specific release version of the repository:
1. Navigate to the [releases](https://github.com/Azure/BicepModulesDemo/releases) page.
1. Scroll to the `'Assets'` section at the bottom end of the release you'd like to download
1. Here you will find a packaged version of the repository (as it was when the release was created) and can download it with a simple click on the `'Source code'` package (e.g. `Source code (zip)`) itself. This will start the download and drop the file in your default download folder.

1. On your local machine, open a PowerShell session
1. Navigate to the location you want to clone the repository into
1. Execute

    ```PowerShell
    git clone 'https://github.com/Azure/BicepModulesDemo.git'
    ```

# 2. (Optional) Convert library to ARM

Note that in case you don't want to use Bicep, you always have the option to use the utility `ConvertTo-ARMTemplate`, we provide in path `utilities/tools`, to convert the repository to an ARM-only repository. For further information on how to use the tool, please refer to the tool-specific [documentation](./Interoperability%20-%20Bicep%20to%20ARM%20conversion).

# 3. Build a solution

With the codebase ready you can now start to build a solution. For examples on how to do so, please refer to the corresponding [solution creation](./Solution%20creation) section.
