# Approach

To ensure a baseline module code quality across all the modules, modules are validated before publishing them.

All tests are executed as part of the individual module pipelines, run each time any module code was altered, and ensure that only modules that pass each test successfully are published. If a test fails, it tells you in the pipeline log exactly what went wrong and in most cases gives you recommendations what to do to resolve the problem.

The general idea is that you should fail as early as possible to allow for minimal wasted time and a fast response time.

> ***Note:*** Both the Template Validation and Template Deployment tests are only as good as their parameter files. Hence you should make sure that you test at least a minimum set of parameters and a maximum set of parameters. Furthermore it makes sense to have different parameter files for different scenarios to test each variant.

Tests falls into four categories:

- Static code validation
- API version validation
- Template Validation with parameter file(s)
- Template Deployment with parameter file(s)

---

# Static code validation

All Module Unit tests are performed with the help of [Pester](https://github.com/pester/Pester) and are required to have consistent, clean and syntactically correct tests to ensure that our modules are configured correctly, documentation is up to date, and modules don't turn stale.

The following activities are run executing the `arm/.global/global.module.tests.ps1` script.

- **File & folder tests** validate that the module folder structure is set up in the intended way. e.g.:
  - reame.md must exists
  - template file (either deploy.json or deploy.bicep) exists
  - compliance with file naming convention
- **Deployment template tests** check the template's structure and elements for errors as well as consistency matters. e.g.
  - template file (or the built bicep template) converts from JSON and has all expected properties
  - variable names are camelCase
  - the minimum set of outputs are returned
- **Module (readme.md) documentation** contains all required sections. e.g.:
  - is not empty
  - contains all the mandatory sections
  - describes all the parameters
- **Parameter Files**. e.g.:
  - at least one `*parameters.json` should exist
  - files should be valid JSON

# API version validation

In this phase, the workflow will verify if the module is one of the latest 5 (non-preview) API version using the `arm/.global/global.module.tests.ps1` script.

---

# Template validation

The template validation tests execute a dry-run with each parameter file provided & configured for a module. For example, if you have two parameter files for a module, one with the minimum set of parameters, one with the maximum, the tests will run an `Test-AzDeployment` (_- the command may vary based on the template schema_) with each of the two parameter files to see if the template would be able to be deployed with them. This test could fail either because the template is invalid, or because any of the parameter files is configured incorrectly.

---

# Deployment validation

If all other tests passed, the deployment tests are the ultimate module validation. Using the available & configured parameter files for a module, each is deployed to Azure (in parallel) and verifies if the deployment works end-to-end.

Most of the resources are deleted by default after their deployment, to keep costs down and to be able to retest resource modules from scratch in the next run. However, the removal step can be skipped in case further investigation on the deployed resource is needed. For further details, please refer to the (./PipelinesUsage) section.

This happens using the `utilities/pipelines/resourceDeployment/Test-TemplateWithParameterFile.ps1` script.

> **Note**<br>
Currently the list of the parameter file used to test the module is hardcoded in the module specific workflow, as the **parameterFilePaths** in the _job_deploy_module_ and _job_tests_module_deploy_validate_ jobs.

## Module dependencies
In order to successfully deploy and test all ARM/Bicep modules in your desired environment some modules require certain Azure resources to be deployed beforehand.

> **Note**<br>
If we speak from **modules** in this context we mean the **services** which get created from these modules.

### Resources deployed by the dependency workflow

Together with the resource modules pipelines, we are providing a dependency pipeline (GitHub workflow: `.github\workflows\platform.dependencies.yml`), leveraging resource parameters from the `utilities\dependencies` subfolder.

The resources deployed by the dependency workflow need to be in place before testing all the modules. Some of them (e.g. [storage account], [key vault] and [event hub namespace]) require a globally unique resource name. Before running the dependency workflow, it is required to update those values and their corresponding references in the resource modules parameters.

Alternatively, you can leverage the token replacement utility we integrate by default by setting up your `\<<namePrefix\>>` token. Refer to [Parameter File Tokens Design](./ParameterFileTokens) for more details.

Some of the resources integrated with the full dependency pipeline are disabled by default as they require more time to be deployed or because they may cause issues when running in parallel with some of our module validation pipelines. Those are the sqlmi dependencies and the resources needed to build and distribute a VHD in a storage account. We suggest to enable them explicitly in case you need to onboard the modules requiring them, i.e. respectively [SQL managed instance], [compute disks] and [compute images].

Since also dependency resources are in turn subject to dependencies with each other, resources are deployed in the following grouped order.


**First level resources**

  1. Resource Groups: Leveraged by all modules. Multiple instances are deployed:
     - 'validation-rg': The resource group to which resources are deployed by default during the test deployment phase. This same resource group is also the one hosting the dependencies.

**Second level resources**: This group of resources has a dependency only on the resource group which will host them. Resources in this group can be deployed in parallel.

  1. Storage account: This resource is leveraged by all resources supporting diagnostic settings on a storage account.
      >**Note**: This resource has a global scope name.
  1. Event hub namespace and Event hub: This resource is leveraged by all resources supporting diagnostic settings on an event hub.
      >**Note**: This resource has a global scope name.
  1. Log analytics workspaces: These resources are leveraged by all resources supporting diagnostic settings on LAW. Multiple instances are deployed:
      - '_adp-\<<namePrefix\>>-az-law-x-001_': Default LAW.
      - '_adp-\<<namePrefix\>>-az-law-aut-001_': Dedicated LAW to be leveraged by the [automation account] resource.
      - '_adp-\<<namePrefix\>>-az-law-appi-001_': Dedicated LAW to be leveraged by the [application insights] resource.
  1. User assigned identity: This resource is leveraged by the [role assignment], [key vault] and [recovery services vault] dependency resources.
      > **Note**: The object ID of the [user assigned identity] is needed by several dependency parameter files. However, before running the dependency pipeline for the first time, the [user assigned identity] resource does not exist yet, thus its object ID is unknown. For this reason, instead of the object ID value, some dependency parameter files contain the `"<<msiPrincipalId>>"` token, for which the correct value is retrieved and replaced by the pipeline at runtime.
  1. Shared image gallery and definition: These resources are leveraged by the [image template] resource.
  1. Route table: This resource is leveraged by the virtual network subnet dedicated to test [SQL managed instance].
